# Slingshot Project Instructions

## Todo Management
- Always sync session todos with PLAN.md checkboxes
- When marking a todo as completed, update both:
  1. TodoWrite tool (session todos)
  2. Edit PLAN.md to change [ ] to [x]
- When adding new todos, add to both locations
- Keep both in sync throughout the session

## Development Workflow
- Follow conventional commits (already enforced by structured-commits skill)
- Test before committing significant changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
